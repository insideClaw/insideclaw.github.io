    <div class="panel-body">
        <p>A novel way to draw a random winner for your giveaway. Unlike traditional raffles, this one <b>cannot be rigged!</b></p>
        <p>The raffle algorithm pulls the latest news published by The Guardian newspaper, so <b>even the raffle holder can't know the outcome in advance, yet everyone can verify it for themselves</b>!</p>
        <button data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#usage">To use</button>
        <div id="usage" class="collapse">
        <p>To use, just decide what you want to hold a raffle for, then make your post telling everyone two things:<br>
        1. A <b>keyword</b> of your choice, such as "banana"<br>
        2. The <b>exact time</b> the raffle will be drawn.
        </p>

        <p>That's it! Close to raffle close time, assign every participant a number based on the order in which they've commented - like a lottery ticket.</p>
        <p>When the time is due, <i>anyone</i> can check the results using the two pieces of information! No data is stored at any point.</p>
        <p>Additionally, the code is Open Source and can be inspected for even further transparency.</p>
